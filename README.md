<h1 align="center">🛒 Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform</h1>

## 👋 About This Project

I built this full-stack e-commerce platform as part of my journey to become a proficient full-stack developer. This project represents my deep dive into modern web development practices, focusing on **end-to-end type safety**, **advanced state management**, and **scalable architecture**.

As a developer passionate about React, Next.js, Express, and modern ORMs like Drizzle and Prisma, I designed this application to challenge myself and showcase production-ready code that I'd be proud to share with fellow developers and potential employers.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- **Clerk Integration** - I implemented seamless user management with `clerk-react` and `clerk-express`
- **Webhook-Based User Sync** - I used Clerk webhooks to automatically register users in my database
- **Secure API Communication** - I created Axios interceptors that automatically inject authorization tokens into every request

### 🛍️ E-Commerce Core
- **Product Management** - Full CRUD operations that I built from scratch
- **Interactive Comments** - Commenting system I designed for product engagement
- **Type-Safe Database** - I architected a fully typed relational schema using Drizzle ORM

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
- **Full TypeScript** - I ensured complete type safety across both client and server
- **Optimized Data Fetching** - I leveraged TanStack Query for efficient server state management
- **Serverless Database** - I integrated Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalability
- **Type-Safe ORM** - I chose Drizzle ORM for its zero runtime overhead and excellent TypeScript support

## 📌 What I Learned

I built this project with specific learning goals in mind:

- ✅ **Mastered TanStack Query** - I now understand advanced caching strategies, optimistic updates, and complex data synchronization patterns
- ✅ **Achieved Full-Stack Type Safety** - I successfully implemented TypeScript across the entire stack, from database schemas to UI components
- ✅ **Gained Drizzle ORM Expertise** - I learned how to design efficient, type-safe database schemas and queries
- ✅ **Implemented Production-Ready Webhooks** - I built a robust Clerk webhook system for user synchronization

</br>

### Key Takeaways

**Type Safety is Game-Changing** - Having types flow from the database to the frontend caught countless bugs before runtime.

**TanStack Query Transformed My Approach** - I learned how to think about server state differently, leveraging caching and background refetching.

**Webhooks Require Careful Design** - I discovered the importance of idempotency and error handling in webhook systems.

**ORMs Can Be Beautiful** - Drizzle's approach to type inference made database work actually enjoyable.

<h1 align="center">🐛 Challenges & Solutions</h1>

## 1. TypeScript + Node ESM + Drizzle Import Issue

Maybe you’ve run into this before — I recently ran into a tricky issue when using TypeScript with Node ESM (`moduleResolution: NodeNext`) together with Drizzle. The problem is that Node wants `.js` extensions in relative imports, but Drizzle’s CLI breaks if those `.js` files don’t exist yet because it executes the TypeScript source. Essentially, Node ESM and Drizzle expect incompatible import styles, and TypeScript can’t satisfy both at the same time.

## How I handled it

A practical workaround I found was to **compile the project first** and then let Drizzle operate on the compiled output:

1. Add an `outDir` to your `tsconfig`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

2. Update `package.json` scripts to build before running Drizzle:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "db:migrate": "pnpm build && drizzle-kit generate",
    "db:push": "pnpm build && drizzle-kit push"
  }
}
```

3. Point Drizzle to the compiled files in your `dist` folder:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./dist/src/**/*.schema.js",
});
```

This isn’t perfect, and you might need to tweak it depending on your project, but it worked well for me.
